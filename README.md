CPetriNet is PetriNet simulator written in C/C++ on Windows. It simulates the processing of [CPN Tools](http://cpntools.org/). CPN Tools is a very useful but GUI tool. So we can't do large-scale experiments because it doesn't provide an API. CPetriNet doesn't rely on but simulates all elements about CPN Tools.

# Build
